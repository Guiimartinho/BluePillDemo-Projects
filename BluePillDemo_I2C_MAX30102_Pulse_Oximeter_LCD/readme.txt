This project combines the BluePillDemo_I2C_Pulse_Oximeter and 
BluePillDemo_LCD_ST7789 projects to drive a pulse oximeter sensor and display
the output on a 1.3" colour LCD. Instead of a LED showinf detected heartbeats
a simple graph is plotted on the LCD.

See both the above projects for details. In particular note the problem with 
fake Chinese MAX30102 sensor chips.

Schematic provided.
