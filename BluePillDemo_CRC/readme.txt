This example uses the STM32F103 on chip CRC module to calculate the CRC of a fixed text string.
The CRC algorithm that the processor uses is CRC-32/MPEG-2. The calculated CRC can be seen via
debugging and compared with results from the test website https://crccalc.com/.

No schematic file for this example.
